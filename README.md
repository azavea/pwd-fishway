### Adding NPM Packages

To add a new NPM package to the project:

- Manually add the package to the project's `package.json` file, ensuring that you 
pin it to a specific version.
- Run `./scripts/update` in the VM.
- Commit the changes to the following files to git:
    - `package.json`
    - `yarn.lock`

#### Notes

* We usually pin packages to a specific version to minimize build errors.
