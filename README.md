- Manually add the package to the project's `package.json` file, ensuring that you 
pin it to a specific version.
- Run `./scripts/update` in the VM.
- Commit the changes to the following files to git:
    - `package.json`
    - `yarn.lock`

### FontAwesome Pro
We are using a paid FontAwesome Pro subscription on this project. Please follow the steps below to properly register the imported font styles with FortAwesome:
1. Add a `.npmrc` file to the same folder as `package.json`.
2. Paste the following in that file:
```
@fortawesome:registry=https://npm.fontawesome.com/
//npm.fontawesome.com/:_authToken={AZAVEA_TOKEN}
```
3. Replace `{AZAVEA_TOKEN}` with the token visible in FontAwesomeâ€™s LastPass notes.

#### Notes

* We usually pin packages to a specific version to minimize build errors.
